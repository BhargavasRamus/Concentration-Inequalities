In question 5, the distributions used are guassian, poisson, uniform and exponential.
it can be observed that with increase in number of random variables, the the distributions tends to converge to guassian.

In question 6, Guassian, Uniform, exponential and Poisson distributions is used to illustrate LLN,
it can be observed that as the number of the random variables are increased, the distribution tends to converge to mean.
